			Ah you thought there was going to be pictures on this page uh. Estoy cobrando para cada foto so if you want to see more pictures of Canela you got to pay up.

			I'm just kidding. I have yet to upload some pictures. I can't seem to make up my mind on which pictures to upload here. Also, this is just the template, meaning the HTML part. I'm still learning CSS and will add some designs and color it to it later on. So this is just a little taste of what I am working on! Hope to send over the HTML with CSS in the next upcoming week :)
